### Wild Animal Intrusion Detection System in Rural Areas with Limited Connectivity

This project is an implementation of a Wild Animal Intrusion Detection System that is specifically focused on rural areas with limited connectivity, not very tech savvy users and limited budget. This fairly innovative project addresses the pressing challenges posed by wildlife intrusions that endanger human safety in remote locations, especially those who are elderly. By taking advantage of advancements in edge computing, low-power communication, and sustainable energy solutions, my project proposal aims to provide an accessible, particularly cost-effective, and efficient detection and alert mechanism.
